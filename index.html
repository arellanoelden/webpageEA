        <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tutor:</strong><p>I have tutored for UCSD for 2 different courses. One course was CSE140L which involved the students using verilog and bsv for their programming assignments. The other class was CSE134 which involved web development where I aided students in first creating sites using just HTML,CSS, and Vanilla JS. Later they replaced the HTML with  ReactJS as well as Redux and I aided many students in explaining concepts as well as helping debug their code.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Webmaster/Webmaster Assistant</strong><p>For 1.5 years now I have been the webmaster for the Leichtag Foundation on campus where I update the site continually as things need to get posted. For the second half of 2017 I worked at CAIDA located at the Super Computer Center in UCSD. Here I also updated the site but also added functionality to many of the pages using Vanilla JS,Jquery, Python, and Bash.</p></li>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Background:</h3>
      <p> I have lived in California my entire life and spent most of life living in
        Victorville. When I first moved there was a pretty small town but after so many
        years is actually rather large. It may still be known as "that stop on the way to Vegas"
        but I enjpyed my time there. Growing up I was always fascinated with computers and
        technology. I would keep up to date with cool apps for my phone or the newest
        smartphone. I also have always enjoyed active activites such as hiking, sports,
        running, etc.</p>
      <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Soccer:</strong><p>From about age 4 to age 19 I played soccer constantly. Sometimes even being on 2 teams at once. Practice every single day, games on weekeneds etc. Nowadays I dont get to play every day and I certainly am not as good as I used to be but I still enjoy going out to play and having a good time.</p></li>
          <li><strong>TV Shows/Movies:</strong><p>Just like anyone else ever I enjoy a good 
          movie or TV Show. Some key ones have been Game of Throns, Parks and Rec, Breaking Bad,
          Daredevil and so on and so forth. As for movies usually enjoy seeing any of the 
            MCU movies or really anything that my group of friends want to watch I'm always down.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Fitness</strong><p>Having grown up doing sports every single year I 
          enjoy doing active things liek hiking, running, etc. So I do my best to stay fit by
          going to the gym, try to eat healthy(don't always do this one), go running, play 
            sports, etc.</p></li>
